## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - The Git repository stores and tracks the changes made to the files.
 * Git - Version Control - The Git version control tracks/records changes made to a file or a set of files, which allows a specific version to be called later on if necessary. 
 * Clone - Git clone is a command that creates a clone or copy of a repository from a remote source into a local machine.
 * Fork - A Git fork is a copy of an existing repository which allows you to make your own changes without impacting the original project.
 * History - Git history refers to the complete record of all changes and commits made to a repository which looks like a graph.
 * Staging - Staging in Git is a step that prepares the changes that will be included in the next commit.
 * Remote - A remote in Git references to a remote repository which allows you to interact and exchange changes. 
 * Commit - Git commit is a command that saves the current state of files in a local repository.
 * Push - Git push is a command used to upload the committed changes in a local repository to a remote repository, making it available to others and updating the history of the remote repository.
